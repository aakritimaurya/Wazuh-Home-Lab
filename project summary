## Objective
To simulate a basic SOC (Security Operations Center) environment by setting up an open-source SIEM platform (Wazuh) on a virtual Ubuntu machine. The project is designed to help understand real-time monitoring, log collection, file integrity checking, and threat detection mechanisms â€” aligned with SOC analyst skillsets.

## Tools and Technologies Used

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Virtual Machine)
VMware Workstation Player
Wazuh 4.7 All-in-One (Manager, Dashboard, Agent)
Firefox Browser (for dashboard access)
curl, bash shell (for installation)

## Installation & Configuration Steps

1. Installed Ubuntu VM using official ISO image
2. Updated system and installed curl
3. Downloaded and executed Wazuh installation script:

#curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
#sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a

4. Accessed Wazuh dashboard via #https://localhost

5.  Verified modules like:
- File Integrity Monitoring
- Security Events
- Policy Monitoring
- System Auditing

## Achievements
Successfully deployed a functional SIEM environment locally
Understood core Wazuh features and SOC concepts
Documented complete setup with screenshots and logs
Added project to GitHub portfolio and resume for job readiness

## Learning Outcomes
How SIEMs collect and visualize security data
How to troubleshoot Linux-based installations
Understanding of log sources, dashboards, and security alerts
Confidence in handling virtual labs and documenting cybersecurity setups

## Future Enhancements
Add another VM as an agent node
Simulate attacks to trigger detection rules
Generate alerts for port scanning, malware, or privilege escalation
Integrate with VirusTotal or Elastic Stack
Use log data for advanced analysis or machine learning in security
