This project involves setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment using Wazuh on an Ubuntu virtual machine. The goal is to build a SOC lab at home using open-source tools to gain hands-on cybersecurity skills.

##Why I Built It:
To practice incident detection, monitoring, and security auditing
To prepare for SOC Analyst roles
To apply practical skills for my IGNOU college project

##What I Learned:
How to install and configure Wazuh all-in-one
How SIEM dashboards help in detecting threats
How to work with virtual machines and troubleshoot installation issues

##Next Steps:
Add real agents to generate security events
Use sample logs or test attacks to trigger alerts
Document complete use-case for my final BCA/IGNOU project
